# SimpleFormMailer

This is a dead simple PHP form mailer utilising [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE).
You sent your form data as a form submission to the endpoint, the script will e-mail the form submission to you.

Anti-Spam: The hidden form field checksum must be set to Brotzeit

## Licensing

As laid out earlier, the script makes use of the PHPMailer licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1.
Thus, we license our project under the same license.
