# SimpleFormMailer

This is a dead simple PHP form mailer utilising [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer/blob/master/LICENSE).
You sent your form data as a json to the endpoint, the script will e-mail the form submission to you.
Be warned that the script has no anti-spam.

## Licensing

As laid out earlier, the script uses the PHPMailer licensed under the GNU GPL 2.
Thus, we license our project utilizing it under the same license.
